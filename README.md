## Requirements

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the auction system:

### 1. Database Setup

1. Create a MySQL database named `auction_system` or use your preferred name.
2. Import the database schema from `auction_system.sql` using phpMyAdmin or MySQL command line:

```
```

### 2. Configure Database Connection

Open `php/config.php` and update the database connection parameters:

```php
define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');      // Database server
define('DB_USERNAME', 'your_username'); // Database username
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_password'); // Database password
define('DB_NAME', 'auction_system');    // Database name
```

### 3. Server Configuration

1. Copy all files to your web server directory (e.g., `/var/www/html/auction_system` or `C:\xampp\htdocs\auction_system`).
2. Make sure the web server has read and write permissions to the project directory.

### 4. Base URL Configuration

Update the `BASE_URL` constant in `php/config.php` to match your server setup:

```php
define('BASE_URL', 'http://your-domain.com/auction_system');
```

Or for local development:

```php
define('BASE_URL', 'http://localhost/auction_system');
```

## Usage

### Admin Account

The system comes with a pre-configured admin account:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

### Regular User

1. Register a new account from the registration page.
2. Browse available auctions or create your own.
3. Place bids on active auctions.
4. Track your bidding history and auction wins.

## Customization

### Adding Categories

To add more categories, insert them into the `categories` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO categories (name, description) VALUES ('New Category', 'Description of the category');
```

### Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS via CDN. You can customize the styling by modifying the classes or extending Tailwind in a local setup.
